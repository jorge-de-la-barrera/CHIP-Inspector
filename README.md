# CHIP-Inspector

CHIP Inspector is a bioinformatics tool for the identification of somatic mutations potentially causative of clonal hematopoiesis with high sensitivity from deep-sequencing NGS data. It can be used in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies to characterize clonal expansion and the influence of CHIP driver mutations on pathological processes.
