# Overview
The accumulation of somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells can lead to a clonal expansion of these mutant cells, a phenomenon referred to as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential or CHIP (Steensma et al., 2015). Recent studies describe CHIP as a novel cardiovascular risk factor independent of traditional risk factors (Fuster and Walsh, 2018; Jaiswal et al., 2017; Páramo Fernández, 2018). Identifying individuals with CHIP can have significant implications for the management of cardiovascular diseases. To facilitate the study of CHIP's influence on these conditions, a bioinformatics tool called CHIP Inspector has been created.

# CHIP-Inspector

CHIP Inspector is a bioinformatics tool for the identification of somatic mutations potentially causative of clonal hematopoiesis with high sensitivity from deep-sequencing NGS data. It can be used in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies to characterize clonal expansion and the influence of CHIP driver mutations on pathological processes.
